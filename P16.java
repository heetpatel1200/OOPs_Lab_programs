/**A bank wants to offer a facility to calculate EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for
Different types of loans. Design a class LoanCalculator with the following overloaded
Methods:
 calculateEMI(int principal, int time, float rate): For home loans
 calculateEMI(double principal, int time, double rate): For vehicle loans
 calculateEMI(int principal, int time): For short-term personal loans with a fixed interest rate of 10%
Demonstrate the use of all three methods in the main method by calculating EMIs for
Different loan types.*/
